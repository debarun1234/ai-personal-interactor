# Space & Outer Space — Missions and Vision (ISRO, NASA, ESA)

## ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation)

### Chandrayaan-5 / LUPEX
A flagship Indo-Japanese collaboration with JAXA, **LUPEX (Lunar Polar Exploration)** is a 2028–2029 mission to the Moon’s South Pole. Equipped with a lander and rover, its core objectives include:
- Mapping ice reserves in permanently shadowed craters
- Understanding lunar regolith composition
- Testing survivability in low-light, low-temperature lunar conditions

This builds on the success of Chandrayaan-3 and aims to enable future sustainable lunar exploration.

### NISAR (NASA–ISRO SAR Mission)
Launched in **July 2025** via **GSLV-F16**, NISAR is a high-resolution Earth observation mission featuring:
- Dual-band SAR: L-band (NASA) and S-band (ISRO)
- Imaging Earth’s surface movements with cm-level accuracy
- Monitoring glacial retreat, tectonic activity, deforestation, and crop dynamics

NISAR represents one of the most advanced remote sensing collaborations, bridging climate science, disaster resilience, and agriculture.

### SpaDeX (Space Docking Experiment)
India’s first autonomous docking demo in space. Two satellites — a Chaser and a Target — successfully completed:
- Rendezvous maneuvers
- Proximity operations
- Docking and separation

This experiment, conducted in **December 2024**, lays the groundwork for in-orbit refueling, on-orbit assembly, and future space station modules.

### Gaganyaan & Bharatiya Antariksh Station
India’s crewed spaceflight program has entered execution phase:
- Gaganyaan uncrewed tests completed
- Re-entry and parachute systems validated
- Crewed mission expected around 2025–2026

Long-term plan includes **Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS)** — a modular Indian space station, with:
- **BAS-1** launching by 2028
- Full station completion by 2035
- Orbiting astronauts for 15–30 days in early phases

### Venus Orbiter Mission (Shukrayaan)
Approved in **2024** and targeting **2028 launch**, the VOM mission will:
- Study Venusian atmospheric chemistry, super-rotation, and pressure systems
- Use synthetic aperture radar and infrared spectrometers

This mission deepens India’s planetary science ambitions, joining the ranks of past Mars and Moon programs.

### Space Agriculture at ISS
As part of **Axiom Mission-4 (May 2025)**, Indian astronaut **Shubhanshu Shukla** conducted:
- Growth of **moong (green gram)** and **fenugreek** under microgravity
- Studies for nutrition-dense, quick-cycling crops for life support

This is a milestone for India’s role in closed-loop life support systems, applicable to lunar/Mars habitats.

## NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)

### NISAR Collaboration
Shared with ISRO — it marks the first major dual-platform Earth imaging partnership and opens a new model for global climate-monitoring missions.

### TRACERS Mission
Launched July 2025, TRACERS explores:
- Magnetic reconnection at the magnetosphere boundary
- Space weather impacts on satellites, power grids, and communications

It enhances our understanding of solar wind interaction with Earth’s magnetic field.

### Artemis Program & CLPS
NASA’s Artemis program includes:
- **Artemis II (2025–26)**: First crewed lunar mission in decades
- **CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services)**: Delivering robotic payloads to Moon

These aim to build a sustainable Moon base, leading toward Mars exploration.

### ISS Resupply & Science
Regular **Cygnus** and **Dragon** missions resupply the ISS:
- Support ongoing biology, materials, and robotics experiments
- Prepare for next-gen space habitats and zero-gravity industry

## ESA (European Space Agency)

### JUICE & Space Science
- **JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer)** launched 2023, arriving at Jupiter system ~2031
- Will explore Ganymede, Callisto, Europa for potential life-supporting environments

ESA continues operations of **Integral**, **Gaia**, and Earth climate monitors.

### AI in Satellite Autonomy
Since 2022, ESA has:
- Funded autonomous navigation and fault prediction systems using AI
- Enhanced space debris tracking and AI-enhanced EO image interpretation

These efforts align with ESA’s vision of intelligent, self-correcting spacecraft.

### Space Rider (Reusable Orbital Plane)
- Scheduled for launch by 2026
- Conducts multiple orbital missions, then glides back for runway landing
- Focus on sustainable access to space for microgravity experiments

### ESA–ISRO Ground Compatibility
ESA’s **ESTRACK network** is integrated with India’s **Gaganyaan** support infrastructure, showing cross-continental agency collaboration in space comms and safety assurance.

## Vision & Impact

### Connecting to AI + SRE
These global missions represent live case studies of:
- **AI for autonomy & anomaly detection**: NISAR, ESA satellites, Artemis guidance systems
- **Resilience engineering**: SpaDeX docking, Gaganyaan re-entry validation, Space Rider
- **High-reliability, high-uncertainty operations**: Venus and Jupiter probes, ISS life support systems, CLPS landers

This makes the perfect proving ground for Debarun’s long-term vision: **merging AI + SRE principles** in space operations, planetary base logistics, and frontier tech like AI-powered decision systems in unpredictable environments.

### Future Pathways
- **Digital twins for spacecraft and habitats**
- **LLM-driven mission planning agents**
- **RAG-based anomaly explainers for onboard astronauts**
- **Autonomous station operations with failover & observability layers**

These missions are not just news—they are live inspiration for career directions, research proposals, and visionary contributions beyond Earth.
