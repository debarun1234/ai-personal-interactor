# I Skipped LeetCode — Here’s What Got Me Into AI Anyway (Personal Memo)

## The Unconventional Start
I never went down the LeetCode rabbit hole. No 300-day streaks, no 6 a.m. grind to master binary trees. My journey didn’t begin on coding platforms—it began with curiosity. I wanted to know how systems work, how they break, and how to make them better.

Over time, I leaned into infrastructure challenges, tinkered with LangChain and RAG pipelines, and explored ways to merge AI with scalable, cloud-native systems. Most of what I know today wasn’t learned on a whiteboard—it came from terminal windows, version control conflicts, late-night debugging, and breaking things in test environments.

## The LeetCode Conundrum
LeetCode has its place. It’s great for sharpening algorithmic thinking, especially for FAANG-style interviews. But in 2025, the career landscape in AI is shifting. More and more, companies want to see:
- Can you launch something end-to-end?
- Do you understand the interplay between infrastructure and AI systems?
- Can you trace, monitor, and explain model behavior?
- Are you working with modern stacks like LangChain, vector databases, or retrieval-augmented pipelines?

In my experience, execution beats exam prep—every time.

## What Worked for Me (And Might Work for You)
Instead of solving hundreds of practice problems, I focused on building. I created small tools that solved problems I cared about. I automated tasks, experimented with APIs, and learned from broken deployments. These projects helped me:
- Develop practical problem-solving skills.  
- Build a public portfolio (GitHub speaks louder than bullet points).  
- Learn by doing, not just memorizing patterns.

Most importantly, projects teach ownership. When you build, deploy, watch something fail, and then fix it, you develop a kind of resilience no coding challenge can replicate.

## So, What Should You Focus On?
If your goal is to break into AI in 2025, project-based learning and open-source contributions might give you an edge LeetCode won’t. Still, balance matters. Use LeetCode to sharpen your foundations, but don’t wait until you’re “done” with it to start building.

You learn faster when you have something real at stake.

Cast your vote, and if you have a story, share it—I’d love to hear your perspective.

## Final Thought
This isn’t a guide. It’s just a glimpse of my path—a slightly unconventional one that still led me into the heart of AI infrastructure. If it resonates, I hope it encourages you to choose the road that excites you, even if it’s not on a top-100 problem list.

Until next time,
