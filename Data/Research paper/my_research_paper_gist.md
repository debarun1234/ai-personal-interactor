## P1 — *Energy Consumption Saving in 5G Network Based on AI* (ICONAT 2023)

### 1) One‑Line Pitch
AI/ML orchestrates existing RAN power‑saving features to cut energy in 5G/HetNets without sacrificing coverage or QoS.

### 2) Problem Statement
5G’s dense deployments and heterogeneous layers increase power draw. Operators need methods that reduce RAN energy while respecting traffic variability, latency (e.g., URLLC), and reliability.

### 3) Key Ideas & Contributions
- **Feature catalog:** Sleep modes, carrier/channel shutdowns, micro/macro cell coordination, DRX/paging tuning, cross‑slot scheduling, etc.
- **AI fit:** GA/PSO and other ML tools select optimal subsets of active BSs/carriers, power levels, and scheduler parameters under traffic and QoS constraints.
- **6G outlook:** Energy‑aware radio becomes a first‑class objective alongside throughput and latency.

### 4) Conceptual Method Map
- **Inputs:** Traffic load per cell, interference estimates, QoS targets, coverage constraints.
- **Decisions:** Which BSs/carriers/channels to stay active; power levels; scheduling policies (e.g., PDCCH density, paging cycle).
- **Objective(s):** Minimize total energy subject to SLA constraints; maximize energy efficiency (bits/Joule).
- **Optimizers:** GA/PSO, multi‑objective variants (e.g., MOEA), RL for dynamic adaptation.

### 5) Practical Notes & Trade‑offs
- **Energy vs QoS:** Skipping or thinning control‑plane signals can save power but risks higher latency or missed detection—tune conservatively for URLLC.
- **Coverage holes:** Aggressive BS sleep/off decisions can create coverage gaps—add constraints for minimum RSRP/RSRQ across UEs.
- **Operationalization:** SON loops to push policies; telemetry to monitor traffic and rollback rapidly.

### 6) Limitations & Future Work (for my roadmap)
- Benchmark against standard schedulers; quantify latency/reliability impact.
- Add realistic traffic models (diurnal patterns, hotspots) and mobility.
- Integrate with vendor power‑saving features (DRX timers, paging parameters) for ground‑truth trials.

### 7) Repro/Implementation Checklist
- Define KPIs: total energy (Watt‑hours), energy per bit, BLER, latency percentiles.
- Build a scenario set: urban macro + small cells, spectrum mix, UE distributions.
- Implement two control profiles: **Conservative** (QoS‑safe) vs **Aggressive** (max savings) to bound results.

## P2 — *Energy Saving using GA and PSO Hybrid Model*

### 1) One‑Line Pitch
Hybrid GA+PSO jointly optimizes channel shutdown and load handling to minimize energy while meeting traffic demands.

### 2) Problem Statement
Static heuristics miss the moving target of traffic dynamics. We need a tunable search‑plus‑adapt scheme that finds low‑energy configurations and adjusts to load variation.

### 3) Model Overview
- **Objective:** \(O(E,T)=\alpha E + (1-\alpha)T\)  
  - \(E\): total energy consumption; \(T\): traffic/load cost (e.g., blocking, delay proxy).  
  - \(\alpha\) balances energy vs traffic responsiveness.
- **Division of Labor:**  
  - **GA:** channel assignment & interference‑aware pruning (search broad solution space).  
  - **PSO:** traffic‑adaptive fine‑tuning (continuous parameter updates to keep QoS).

### 4) Algorithm Sketch
1. **Initialize**: Encode BS/carrier/channel states for GA; define PSO particles for tunable parameters (e.g., power levels, thresholds).
2. **GA loop**: Selection → crossover → mutation; evaluate \(O(E,T)\) under constraints.
3. **PSO loop**: Starting from GA’s best, update particles using social/cognitive terms; re‑evaluate \(O(E,T)\).
4. **Selection**: Keep the better of GA vs PSO (or ensemble) per iteration/epoch.
5. **Convergence**: Stop when \(O(E,T)\) stabilizes or max epochs reached.

### 5) Constraints & Feasibility Checks
- Coverage constraint (min RSRP across served UEs).
- QoS constraint (latency/throughput floors by service class; URLLC conservative bounds).
- Interference/power caps per carrier.

### 6) Experimental Setup (illustrative)
- **Topology:** Mix of macro/small cells; configurable BS count.
- **Traffic:** Random + hotspot loads; adjustable diurnal profile.
- **Parameters:** GA population/epochs; PSO particles/inertia/cognitive/social weights; \(\alpha\) grid (e.g., 0.3/0.5/0.7).
- **Outputs:** Energy histograms, channel‑off matrices, load vs delay curves, GA vs PSO vs Hybrid comparisons.

### 7) Result Highlights (interpreted)
- **Energy:** GA tends to shut down high‑cost channels early → lower total energy.  
- **Traffic/QoS:** PSO helps recover QoS under load spikes by nudging parameters.  
- **Hybrid:** Best of both when \(\alpha\) is tuned to scenario.

### 8) Sensitivity & Ablations (to add)
- Vary \(\alpha\) and report Pareto curve (Energy vs Traffic metric).  
- Remove PSO (GA‑only) and GA (PSO‑only) to quantify synergy.  
- Stress‑test on hotspots and mobility bursts.

### 9) Limitations & Future Work
- Need standardized baselines (e.g., vendor default schedulers, simple greedy).
- Include paging/DRX parameters, PDCCH density, and sleep mode timers in the decision vector.
- Hardware‑in‑the‑loop or ns‑3/5G‑sim validation.

### 10) Repro/Implementation Checklist
- Code modules: `ga_core.py`, `pso_core.py`, `hybrid_runner.py`, `metrics.py`, `scenario_loader.py`.  
- Configs: `topology.yaml`, `traffic.yaml`, `constraints.yaml`, `sweep_alpha.yaml`.  
- Logs/Artifacts: `runs/<date>/` with `config.json`, `metrics.csv`, `plots/`.

## Cross‑Paper Knowledge Map (for bot grounding)

### Concepts & Terms
- **RAN power‑saving levers:** sleep modes, carrier/channel shutdown, DRX timers, paging cycles, PDCCH scheduling density, cross‑slot scheduling.
- **Optimizers:** GA (discrete combinatorial search), PSO (continuous adaptation), MOEAs, RL for dynamic policies.
- **KPIs:** total energy, energy/bit, coverage %, BLER, latency p50/p95/p99, throughput by slice.

### Claims → Evidence Types
- *Claim:* “Energy falls with controlled channel shutdowns.” → *Evidence:* Energy histograms vs active channels; coverage/QoS constraint checks.
- *Claim:* “Hybrid beats single optimizer.” → *Evidence:* GA‑only vs PSO‑only vs Hybrid curves across \(\alpha\) values.
- *Claim:* “Control‑plane tweaks save power with latency risk.” → *Evidence:* Paging/DRX/PDCCH parameter sweeps vs latency/reliability.

### Reuse Patterns
- **Static scenario:** Prefer GA‑heavy search; lock in low‑energy topology.  
- **Dynamic loads:** Keep PSO loop active for adaptation.  
- **High‑reliability slice:** Increase weights/constraints on latency/BLER; conservative power‑saving.
